Ansible playbooks for voldenuit

# Usefull commands
`ansible-playbook playbook-master.yml`
`ansible 4voldenuit -a "echo ok" -u pi`
`ansible 4voldenuit -a "sudo reboot" -u pi --sudo`
`ansible voldenuit01.local -m service -a "name=watchy state=restarted" -u pi --sudo`

# Copy instead of pull&build

Using git on 64 computers at the same time is too slow.
Therefore I recommend building watchy only once on a test raspberry, then copying the watchy folder to this folder, and then use the synchronise module as showin in playbook-master.yml
